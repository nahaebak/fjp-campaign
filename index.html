      <h2>Party Platform Page</h2>
      <p class="muted">10 platform planks across social, economic, foreign, and domestic issues (2–4 sentences each).</p>

      <ol class="platform">
        <li>
          <b>Climate Action & Clean Energy</b><br/>
          We support large-scale public investment in renewable energy, clean manufacturing, and climate resilience.
          Our approach aligns with the <i>Inflation Reduction Act (2022)</i>, which used federal tools to accelerate clean energy
          deployment and domestic production.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Healthcare Access & Lower Drug Costs</b><br/>
          Healthcare should be affordable and accessible. We support policy that reduces prescription drug costs and expands access,
          including reforms like Medicare drug-price negotiation authorized in the <i>Inflation Reduction Act (2022)</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Women’s Reproductive Freedom</b><br/>
          We support federal protections for reproductive rights, including access to contraception and abortion.
          Decisions about pregnancy belong to individuals and their medical providers, not politicians.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>AI Regulation & Creative Rights</b><br/>
          AI companies must not train on artists’ work without consent and compensation. We support transparency requirements for training data,
          opt-out/opt-in mechanisms, and enforceable penalties for unauthorized use that harms designers, illustrators, and creators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Social Welfare & Poverty Reduction</b><br/>
          We support targeted anti-poverty programs that strengthen child wellbeing and stabilize working families.
          A strong safety net improves long-term economic participation and community health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Disability Rights & Accessibility</b><br/>
          We support stronger enforcement of disability protections and expanded accessibility standards in housing, transit, and digital services.
          Government should remove barriers so every citizen can fully participate in society.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>LGBTQ+ Civil Rights</b><br/>
          We support federal anti-discrimination protections in employment, housing, healthcare, and education.
          Equal treatment under the law is non-negotiable, and dignity should not depend on zip code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fair Taxation & Responsible Budgets</b><br/>
          We support a progressive tax system where large corporations contribute fairly. In contrast to the <i>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017)</i>,
          which prioritized broad tax reduction, we emphasize balanced growth that funds public goods and reduces inequality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Education & Workforce Transition</b><br/>
          We support investment in public education and job training, especially for workers displaced by automation and AI.
          The economy should reward work while helping people adapt to technological change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Foreign Policy: Alliances & Human Security</b><br/>
          We support strong alliances, diplomacy, and global cooperation on climate and technology standards.
          Security includes energy stability, disaster resilience, and democratic norms—not only military strength.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- STRATEGY -->
    <section id="strategy" class="section card" style="margin-top:18px">
      <h2>Campaign Strategy Page</h2>
      <p class="muted">A short campaign plan covering four topics (100+ words per topic).</p>

      <h3>1) Fundraising Approach (100+ words)</h3>
      <p>
        The FJP campaign will rely primarily on small-dollar fundraising to signal independence from corporate influence and to build a
        grassroots identity. We will use recurring monthly donations, clear “what your $10 funds” breakdowns, and transparent reporting to
        increase trust. Fundraising events will include community town halls, climate-service days with local partners, and creative-industry
        meetups focused on AI and copyright protection. We will also seek support from aligned advocacy organizations through legal,
        disclosure-compliant channels, while prioritizing donor diversity over a small set of major contributors. The message is simple:
        policy credibility requires financial credibility, and our campaign will be “people-funded.”
      </p>

      <h3>2) Staff / Volunteer Recruitment (100+ words)</h3>
      <p>
        Recruitment will focus on motivated communities already engaged in our core issues: climate activism, women’s rights groups,
        disability and civil rights organizations, and creative professionals affected by AI training practices. We will create a structured
        volunteer ladder (supporter → volunteer → team lead → regional coordinator) and provide short, practical training modules for canvassing,
        phone banking, and digital outreach. Paid staff hiring will prioritize inclusion and representation, especially from communities most
        impacted by policy outcomes. Because I am a Korean student, we will also highlight immigrant and international perspectives in outreach,
        emphasizing that U.S. democracy benefits when it learns from global best practices in sustainability and social protection.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Target Audience & Messaging (100+ words)</h3>
      <p>
        Our key audiences are Gen Z and Millennial voters, suburban women, working families facing healthcare and cost pressures, and creative
        workers concerned about AI misuse. Messaging will combine values and practicality: “protecting rights,” “lowering costs,” and “building
        a safer future” through clean energy and ethical technology. We will frame climate policy as both moral responsibility and job creation,
        emphasizing domestic manufacturing and community resilience. For women’s rights, we will use clear language about autonomy and privacy.
        For AI, we will highlight real stories from designers and illustrators to show why consent and compensation matter. The tone will be
        hopeful, policy-specific, and coalition-friendly.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Media Strategy (100+ words)</h3>
      <p>
        We will prioritize a “digital-first, credibility-always” media strategy. Short-form videos on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts
        will explain one policy at a time (e.g., “What ethical AI training means in 45 seconds”). Longer YouTube interviews and podcasts will
        provide depth for engaged voters. Traditional media will be used selectively for major announcements and to reach older audiences, with
        a focus on healthcare affordability and economic fairness. We will host live-streamed town halls for transparency and accessibility, and
        publish weekly policy briefs for journalists and supporters. Paid ads will target issue-based segments ethically, avoiding misinformation
        tactics and emphasizing clarity over outrage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- REFLECTION -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section card" style="margin-top:18px">
      <h2>Reflection Page (150+ words)</h2>
      <p class="muted"><b>Replace the bracketed parts</b> with your partner’s name + your role details.</p>

      <p>
        My partner was <b>[Partner Name]</b>. We worked together with one of us acting as the campaign manager and the other as the presidential
        candidate. The most challenging part of creating a unified platform was balancing idealistic goals with a strategy that could realistically
        attract a broad coalition of voters. Even within a progressive vision, priorities can conflict: for example, some supporters want maximum
        climate spending immediately, while others focus on healthcare costs or economic insecurity. Our roles shaped the final platform. As the
        candidate, I focused on clear values—women’s rights, social protections, climate action, and AI regulation for creative workers. My partner,
        as the manager, emphasized messaging discipline and feasibility: what we could explain simply, what would resonate with key groups, and how
        to avoid creating unnecessary vulnerabilities. This process taught me that political parties function as organized coalitions. A party is not
        only a set of beliefs; it is also a brand, a strategy, and a system for coordinating people with different interests. Building a party means
        negotiating priorities and presenting a coherent story to voters.
